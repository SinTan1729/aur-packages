## AUR Packages

A backup of my [AUR packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?K=Sintan&SeB=m).

To push to AUR, first do `makepkg --srcinfo > .SRCINFO `, then add and commit the
`PKGBUILD` and `.SRCINFO` files, finally push them to AUR.

# Note

I don't personally update `topgrade-bin` anymore. It's updated automatically by the upstream using a GitHub action. I only touch
it if something goes wrong. So the backup here is probably old.
